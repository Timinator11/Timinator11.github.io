The Burnu of Land Management (BLM) defines plants into 5 categories based on their \n          adaptations to fire.  <br></br><br></br>\n\n          Resisters are plants that can survive low-intensity fires with little damage. Think big, tall trees with \n          thick bark. Their leaves are also hard to burn. Some examples include the sugar pine and the Douglas-fir.   \n          <br></br><br></br>\n\n          Sprouters are plants that resprout from their roots or other part after a fire. Many shrubs, oaks, and \n          aspens fall into this category. <br></br><br></br>\n\n          Seeders are plants that spread their seeds after a fire. They take advantage of the lack of competition. \n          Some examples are the lodgepole pine and buckbrush \n          <br></br><br></br>\n\n          Invaders are like seeders but did not initially live in the area affected by the fire. Weeds like star \n          thistle and scotch broom are examples.  \n          <br></br><br></br>\n\n          Avoiders are just plants that don’t grow in fire prone environments.  \n          <br></br><br></br>\n\n          Regular surface fires keep forests and prairies healthy. They help manage overgrowth and give nutrients to\n          the soil. Controlled surface fires are performed regularly now by the BLM and subsidiary land management \n          organizations. The important distinction is that these fires are small and contained. Many small, contained \n          fires can actually help clear fuel that could eventually start larger, dangerous wildfires.</p>\n        </Accordion.Body>\n      </Accordion.Item>\n\n      <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"3\">\n        <Accordion.Header>Wildfire Causes</Accordion.Header>\n        <Accordion.Body color=\"blue\">\n        <p> In order to start a fire, dry fuel, oxygen, and a spark is needed for a fire to burn. Fires can\n          either be started by natual or man-made causes.\n\n          Lightning is the most common natural cause of wildfire ignition. Human related fires are the\n          most common cause of fire in North America. These fires can be caused from a variety of sources, including \n          campfires, equipment failure, debris burning, cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson.\n          Nearly 85% of wildfires in North America are human caused. <br></br><br></br>\n\n          Due to climate change, drought and extreme heat are increasly common in states such as California.\n          These conditions over long periods of time create the perfect conditions for a spark to turn into an uncontrolled\n          fire. Recent trends show a large increase of forest fires across the US. One way to help combat these\n          statistics is through better land management practices. Forest thinning an controlled burns can reduce the\n          amount of flammable material on the forest floor and can thus decrease the chances of forest fires. </p>\n        </Accordion.Body>\n      </Accordion.Item>\n\nx\n\n      <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"4\">\n        <Accordion.Header>Wildfire Prevention</Accordion.Header>\n        <Accordion.Body>\n        <p>According to the US Department of the Interior, 10 ways you can prevent wildfires include:<br></br>\n        1.
